# arduino-smart-blinds

## Frontend web application to control an arduino
This project aims at created a frontent web page that communicates with an arduino via a remote serial terminal (based on https://github.com/bricoleau/WiFiTerm). The arduino controls the blinds in the house.

The goal is to have an web interface that is synced with the current state of the blinds (open/close for every blind). The arduino can also be controlled by regular swithes in the house.
